                        I'm Twana Daniel, a full-stack developer. <br>Director of innovation at Dev Centre House (DCH).  My day to day, code most of the day and avoid meetings as much as possible. I love PHP, Node, and Angular. I have deployed 100+ apps to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and VM's in IBM Cloud Cloud and AWS. I published 30+ blog articles in the IBM Cloud space.                     </p>
                    <p>
                        I have six years of experience in web and mobile development. Recently I have been doing a lot of work using PHP, Node.js, Angular, React.js, and Kubernetes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to travel the world speaking and teaching developers on best practices when using IBM Cloud services. Additionally, working with many large clients at Dev Centre House Ltd. I am good at building great teams.
                    <p>
                        Outside of my work with Dev Centre House Ltd, I spend much of my time learning new stuff all related to web development. I love learning. Lately, I am obsessed with reading personal development books, and I can't stop.                    </p>
