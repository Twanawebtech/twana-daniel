                        I'm Twana Daniel, a 27 year old full-stack developer from Dublin, Ireland. I like working in technologies like Angular, React.js
                        Node.js and PHP. And for my deployments, I love Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and Virtual Servers. I published
                        many blog articles covering these technologies at my
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/author/twanaaziie-ibm-com/">IBM Blog page</a>.

                        I have six years plus experience in developing web and mobile applications. Recently I been doing a lot of work using Node.js,
                        Angular, React.js and Kubernetes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to travel the world speaking and teaching developers on how to develop applications
                        on the Cloud. I love sharing my knowledge and helping others to make awesome apps. </p>

                        Outside of my work with IBM, I spend much of my time learning new stuff all related to software development. I just love
                        learning and picking up new cool tips and tricks for development. Lately, I got obsessed with reading
                        personal development books, and I just can't stop.
                        <br>
                        <br> Here is the list of books I read in 2016 & 2017.
    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Book 1</li>
                            <li>Book 2</li>
                        </ul>
