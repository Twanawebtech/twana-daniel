# Twana-Daniel Personal site
How it's done 
- AngularJS handling the frontend of the site 
- Use GitHub.md files for the article details page 
- Node.js for the backend hosted on IBM Bluemix 
- IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk actions for handling emails and forms 
- MongoDB By Compose to store the posts 

If you want to reuse this, please contact me directly and I will share the backend code also. 

Enjoy...
